# Assignment: Create an Interactive Webpage
This project includes the code for a modern revamp of my previous web-dev project **"Kookaburra Enthusiasts."** This new version introduces `JavaScript` to enhance user experience and interactivity.

## New Features
  * **Custom Form Validation:** The contact form uses a custom `JS` script (`formValidation.js`) to validate user input before submission, ensuring data integrity and providing instant feedback.
  * **Dynamic Text Visibility:** The "See More" buttons in the About section leverage a `JS` script (`textVisibility.js`) to toggle the visibility of additional information, allowing users to interactively explore content without page reloads. Once the information is displayed, the button text also switches to "See Less."

Both `JS` scripts can be found in the project's `/assets/js/` folder.
